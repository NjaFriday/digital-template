<h2>Unholy Grudge 2: A Game that Actually Works</h2>
    <h5>(Sequels always sound cooler than the original)</h5>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A platformer-shooter with fast paced action and only seconds before death.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experiece Goals:</strong>
Players should experience a rushed feeling and mild panic until the objective is met.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer, Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player runs left and right in this strange warehouse, collecting items before he is killed by ghosts.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
[FILL THIS IN]
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player is allowed to simultaneously use four ships for intense collective firepower.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An strange, abandoned warehouse where the grisly murder of a little girl took place.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
    You are police officer Wally Williams who swore to avenge the killing of a little Molly Madison,
    but you have failed to keep up your promise, forgetting about her entirely while on the beat.
    WRONG MOVE. She has become angry, waiting for you to avenge solve her murder, but she has decided
    to accept another form of promise fulfilment: your death. It is your job to hastily find all of the
    evidence from her murder scene to solve her murder before she takes your life in the process.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any age. While the story is dark, there is only comic violence.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
[UNKNOWN]
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep moving. A stationary targert is easier to see.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
My assets are various picture (although only a subset of those are in use), a song from the game "Super Hexagon", and free artwork from Open Game Art.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For ideas, I turned to the Phaser Examples on the Phaser website. Invaders was my strongest influence, where I retrived most of my know on how shooting mechanis is work.
