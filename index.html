<h2>Dog Catcher City</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Four spacecraft cannot destroy life threatening enemies without causing a fierce counter
attack from every enemy fighter
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experiece Goals:</strong>
Players should experience fun with the occasional hint of frustration.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A space shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The four spacecraft are on the four edges of the screen, where left and right control the left and right spacecraft movement, and where the up and down control the top and bottom spacecraft. If an enemy is shot, a circular counter shot is sent by the enemy. The player should avoid these shots while racking up a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
At this point, while playable, a texture problem and a program structure problem plague the prototype, but the idea is still lended well.The next goal would be to finish ironing out the bugs.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player is allowed to simultaneously use four ships for intense collective firepower.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is in space, where physics applies in the littlest sense, and danger from alien space-farers threaten your survival.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story is involved.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
8-16 year olds. Those who have the time to play and the will to keep playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Appoximately 10s seconds per round.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep moving. A stationary targert is easier to see.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
My assets are various picture (although only a subset of those are in use), a song from the game "Super Hexagon", and free artwork from Open Game Art.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For ideas, I turned to the Phaser Examples on the Phaser website. Invaders was my strongest influence, where I retrived most of my know on how shooting mechanis is work.
