<h2>Dog Catcher City</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A simple, shooter-platformer where the hero dog, Woofus McBarkatstuff,
    attempts to save his grimy city from the frightening grip of the evil dog
    catcher clones.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experiece Goals:</strong>
Players should experience tension, frustration when they lose, and accomplishment when they succeed.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A shooter-platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
As Woofus, the player can move vertically and horizontally in front of a 2-D background. In order to avoid the constantly respawning close of the Catcher, boxes on screen can either facilitate your mission by providing a better vantage point from which to shoot, or proving to be a hindrance as another obstracle one must avoid. Gaining 110 points is the win condition, and touching the clones 5 times is the lose condition.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
At this point, only a very early level is playable. It shows the possibility of a twitch reflex-testing shooter being successful despite maintaining a family friendly rating with a four-legged hero.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Instead of swarming the player with more and more enemies, my game is set apart by only having one-on-one fights with an ever improving enemy. Each time a clone dies, it gains speed and size, providing more of a challange without ever truly overwhelming the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is intended to give off a noir style, being set is a grimy city not unlike Chicago or L.A.. A dirty brick wall provides a simple backdrop while wooden crates stack high for use. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no true dramatic tension in my very much E rated game, but it does indeed have a story. Woofus McBarkatstuff, a 20 (dog year) veteren of the NCPD (Nameless City Police Department), was investigating a ring of illegal beef treats on shipment from China when he noticed that every worker unloading the ship looked exactly the same. This was no coincidence, as the criminal ring was put in place to lower dogs to the pound, a much hated place where only <strong>most</strong> dogs make it through. Attempting to stop it, he was outfitted with a B0W-W0W-W0W 4900, an anti-human stun weapon meant to incapacitate the enemy with as little damage as possible. Now he is on a mission to rid the city of its seedy underbelly and allow other dogs freedom at home.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
8-16 year olds. Those who have the time to play and the will to keep playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Appoximately 20 seconds per round.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Do not go beyond the first two levels of boxes. As the clones grow larger, it only becomes that much easier to accidentally touch them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the flying dog catcher from scratch. The brick wall and the asphalt came from a free to use site I navigated to on Google. Woofus and the boxes were taken from Open Game Art, as did all of the music.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not borrow from the Phaser Demos, and as far as I'm aware, there are no other games similar to mine.
