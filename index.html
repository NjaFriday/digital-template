<h2>Unholy Grudge 2: A Game that Actually Works</h2>
    <h5>(Sequels always sound cooler than the original)</h5>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A platformer-shooter with fast paced action and lots of frustration.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experiece Goals:</strong>
Players should experience a rushed feeling and mild panic until the objective is met.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer, Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player runs left and right in this strange warehouse, collecting items before he is killed by ghosts. The warehouse has two levels, so the player must interact with 
ladders. To avoid ghosts, the player may either dodge them or shoot them in any direction with the mouse. To win, the player needs to retrieve 10 pieces of evidence (orbs), scoring 100 points per orb. If the player is struck by a ghost 5 times, the game is lost.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to simulate high-adrenaline gameplay with basic platforming mechanics. High-energy music strengthens this effect on the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Unique aspects of this game are the amazing character art (sarcasm), the very fast pace for platforming, and the setting, a strange story built on criminal investigation and the paranormal.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An strange, abandoned warehouse where the grisly murder of a little girl took place.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
    You are police officer Wally Williams who swore to avenge the killing of a little Molly Madison,
    but you have failed to keep up your promise, forgetting about her entirely while on the beat.
    WRONG MOVE. She has become angry, waiting for you to solve her murder, but in your absence, another form of promise fulfilment has become of interest: your death. It is your job to hastily find all of the
    evidence from her murder scene to solve the crime before she takes your life in the process.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any age. While the story is dark, there is only comic violence.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Approximately 45 seconds to a minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Continually move and shoot, holding down the left mouse button in the direction of your travel.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
My assets are various pictures and audio from opengameart.org, the win-condition song from 3D Realms, and the black and yellow drawing of Officer Williams by me. I chose to leave the MS Paint drawing because I couldn't find a convincing police officer sprite anywhere, and I can't draw to save my life.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
If I had to guess, I would say the older 2D platformers on the SNES and Genesis. I never borrowed code from a Phaser example, but a student post on Piazza did help me to fix my tilemap problems.
